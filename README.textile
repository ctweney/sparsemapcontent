h1. Map Content System.

Development on Sparse Map on this branch has now ceased.

The Sakai OAE managed project team decided to fork this code base and take full responsibility
for future development within their own project on (or arround) 17th March 2011. This branch (currently
the master branch) has been left in tact to allow that team to issue pull requests back into this code
base should they wish to.

The last release from this code based was version 1.5 which was released on 20th March 2011 to give the 
Sakai OAE managed project a future release to bind to if they wanted to.

As detailed in Issue #166 development from 17th March 2011 will continue in the "postOAEFork Branch":https://github.com/ieb/sparsemapcontent/tree/postOAEFork

Please see the readme in that branch for more details.
